## Project Setup and Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

- Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Download and install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- Download and install [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

### Download and Organize Project Files

Download the three folders - `BeachEvents`, `DjangoBackend`, and `ExpressBackend`.

Create a Visual Studio Code workspace and place these folders within the workspace directory.

### Configure React Native Project

Navigate to the `BeachEvents` folder within your Visual Studio Code workspace.

```bash
cd path/to/your/workspace/BeachEvents
npm install
yarn
# Follow React Native documentation for additional setup


`Configure Django Backend`
In a new terminal, Navigate to the DjangoBackend folder within your Visual Studio Code workspace.
pip install Django
# Make sure to use the appropriate Python environment and pip version you have set up.
cd mysite
Start the Django development server with the following command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
This will run the server and make it accessible from any IP address (0.0.0.0) on port 8000. 
# Note: If you are using Python 3, you might use python3 instead of python.

Additional Django Packages (Optional):
Depending on your project requirements, you may need to install additional Django packages. Here are some common ones:
pip install django-crispy-forms  # Improved form rendering
pip install django-allauth       # Authentication
pip install django-rest-framework  # API development
pip install django-cors-headers  # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
# Make sure to use the appropriate Python environment and pip version you have set up.


`Configure Express Backend`
In a new terminal, Navigate to the ExpressBackend folder within your Visual Studio Code workspace.
cd path/to/your/workspace/ExpressBackend
npm install
cd Backend
npm run Backend
# If the command fails, run npm install and verify there is a .env file


`Launch the React Native Application`
Navigate back to the BeachEvents terminal.
npx expo start --clear
# If the command fails, install expo-cli: npm install -g expo-cli


`Access the App`
Ensure Each Terminal is Running:
Keep the terminal where you executed the above commands open.
In the terminal where you started the React Native development server, scan the displayed QR code using the Expo Go app on your mobile device to access and test the application.
