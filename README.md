Title: Beach Events

Description: A react native app project that will allow CSULB students exclusively 
to see any events occuring on campus with the events details.

Instructions for using the application:

1. Start by downloading the necessary files to run React Native and an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio.
2. Open the command prompt and enter the following command: "yarn create expo-app <Name of App>". This will create an Expo project for your app.
3. Download all the files from the Git repository.
4. Copy and paste these downloaded files into your project folder.
5. Open your IDE and access the integrated terminal.
6. Refer to the React Navigation documentation and download the following packages using Yarn:
- React Navigation
- React Navigation Stack
- React Navigation Native Stack
- React Navigation Reanimated
- React Native Gesture Handler
- React Navigation Drawer
- React Native Map
7. In another terminal, install the required packages for your Django backend, including Django, django-corsheaders, django-rest-framework, and requests.
8. In the same terminal, run the following command, replacing "YOUR IP" with the IP address of your computer:
python manage.py runserver "YOUR IP":8000
9. Run the code in the terminal using the command: "npx expo start --clear".
10. Use your mobile device to scan the QR code displayed on the screen. This will allow you to view the app on your device.
